**A general description of the protocol.**  

In this assignment, we implemented a simplified Go-back-N protocol. The fundamental concept is that the sender can send multiple packetsin succession without waiting for an acknowledgement for each packet, thereby improving the efficiency of communication. In case of any anomalies, the sender will go back and retransmit multiple packets to ensure the reliability of the transmission.  
Our protocol implementation includes establishing and terminating connections between the sender and receiver, as weel as sending and receiving messages. In our implementation, the sender sends multiple packets at once based on the size of sending window, and if the transmission fails, it will retransmit. The receiver checks the received packets. If the sequence number of a packet does not meed the expectation or their is an error in the packet data, the receiver well ignore it and wait for the next expected packet. If the expected packet is received, the receiver sends an acknowledgment ACK to the sender. Additionally, we have implemented simple congestion control mechanism, where the window size is dynamically adjusted based on whether the transmission is successful or not. Specifically, we set three window sizes: "slow," "medium," and "fast." If a transmission error occurs, the window size falls back to "slow"; if the transmission is successful, the window size increases by one level. During the implementation process, both the sender and receiver jointly maintain the global window state.
