**A general description of the protocol.**  

In this assignment, we implemented a simplified Go-back-N protocol. The fundamental concept is that the sender can send multiple packetsin succession without waiting for an acknowledgement for each packet, thereby improving the efficiency of communication. In case of any anomalies, the sender will go back and retransmit multiple packets to ensure the reliability of the transmission.  
Our protocol implementation includes establishing and terminating connections between the sender and receiver, as weel as sending and receiving messages. In our implementation, the sender sends multiple packets at once based on the size of sending window, and if the transmission fails, it will retransmit. The receiver checks the received packets. If the sequence number of a packet does not meed the expectation or their is an error in the packet data, the receiver well ignore it and wait for the next expected packet. If the expected packet is received, the receiver sends an acknowledgment ACK to the sender. Additionally, we have implemented simple congestion control mechanism, where the window size is dynamically adjusted based on whether the transmission is successful or not. Specifically, we set three window sizes: "slow," "medium," and "fast." If a transmission error occurs, the window size falls back to "slow"; if the transmission is successful, the window size increases by one level. During the implementation process, both the sender and receiver jointly maintain the global window state.

**Performance optimization under different network reliability assumptions.**

In highly reliable networks with minimal packet loss and errors, GBN can achieve near-optimal throughput, as the sender can continuously dispatch a window of packets without waiting for individual acknowledgments (ACKs), effectively utilizing the available bandwidth. However, as network reliability decreases, the performance of GBN can degrade substantially. This is because the loss of a single packet within the window necessitates the retransmission of all subsequent packets in the window, not just the lost one, leading to increased bandwidth consumption and latency due to the retransmission of successfully received packets. To optimize GBN performance in less reliable networks, adaptive mechanisms can be implemented, such as dynamically adjusting the window size based on current network conditions or incorporating error correction codes to reduce the need for retransmissions. Furthermore, implementing smarter timeout mechanisms that adapt to observed network delays can help in distinguishing between actual packet losses and merely delayed packets, reducing unnecessary retransmissions. Another approach is to integrate feedback about network congestion into the window adjustment algorithm, allowing the sender to reduce its transmission rate proactively before packet loss occurs, which is indicative of congestion. Through such optimizations, the GBN protocol can be made more resilient to varying network conditions, improving its efficiency and reliability across a wider range of scenarios.
